# User Defined Types

In a programming language a **type** is a blueprint, or a template, for creating an object instance in memory. A type defines the capabilities of an object. C# and the .NET Framework provide many types, such as `int`, `decimal`, `bool`, `Datetime`, `string`, `Dictionary`, `List`, etc... There are literally thousands of them!

While these types provide a lot of functionality, each C# application must also provide its own, custom types to do the specific work it needs to do.

In C# the most common way to create a new type is with a `class`.

```cs
public class Writer
{
    public Writer(string prefix)
    {
        Prefix = prefix;
    }

    public string Prefix {get; set;}

    public void Write (string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Prefix + message);
    }
}
```

```cs
// The output variable's type is `string` -- a built in type
string output = "Nashville Software School";

// The author variable's type is Writer -- a custom type you defined
Writer author = new Writer("I do declare: ");
author.Write(output);

author.Prefix = "That's right, I said: ";
author.Write(output);
```

The above code would print the following:

```txt
I do declare: Nashville Software School
That's right, I said: Nashville Software School
```

## Classes vs Objects

The difference between a class and an object is not always easy to see at first. Let's try to clear things up with an analogy.

Let's imagine that you drive a [1994 Ford Taurus](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=1994%20ford%20taurus&tbs=imgo:1). Of course, you love it. And, you know you're not alone. Plenty of other people _(dozens)_ also drive 1994 Ford Tauruses. But do they drive **your** 1994 Ford Taurus? No, of course not, You wouldn't let anyone drive your precious baby.

In C# a class is like the _make and model_, 1994 Ford Taurus. An object, on the other hand, is like **your** 1994 Ford Taurus. The object is the real, specific car. The class is the _**type**_ of the car. We say that **your** car is an _"instance of"_ a 1994 Ford Taurus. If your buddy down the street also has a 1994 Ford Taurus, that would be considered another _instance of_ a 1994 Ford Taurus.

In the C# example above. the class is `Writer` and we create a new `Writer` object to assign to the `author` variable.

```cs
Writer author = new Writer("I do declare: ");
```

## Parts of a Class

### Properties

Class properties are the interface you provide to external code to get, and modify, the data stored inside the object.

```cs
public class Customer
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

    public string LastName { get; set; }

    public bool IsLocal { get; set; }

    // Calculated property that has no setter. It is readonly.
    public string FullName {
        get
        {
            return $"{FirstName} {LastName}";
        }
    }
}
```

### Methods

Methods are the new name for functions. They are code blocks on a class that performs a series of logic. Think of them as the behaviors of your custom type. Copy pasta this example code into your `Program.cs` file.

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Classes
{
    public class Customer
    {
        // Public Properties
        public string FirstName { get; set; }

        public string LastName { get; set; }

        public bool IsLocal { get; set; }

        public string FullName
        {
            get
            {
                return $"{FirstName} {LastName}";
            }
        }
    }

    public class DeliveryService
    {
        /*
          Properties
        */
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public string TransitType { get; set; }

        /*
          Methods
        */
        public void Deliver(Product product, Customer customer)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Product delivered by {TransitType} to {customer.FullName}");
        }
    }

    public class Product
    {
        /*
          Properties
        */
        public string Title { get; set; }

        public string Description { get; set; }

        public double Price { get; set; }

        public int Quantity { get; set; }

        /*
          Methods
        */
        public void Ship(Customer customer, DeliveryService service)
        {
            if (!customer.IsLocal)
            {
                service.Deliver(this, customer);
            }
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Product tinkerToys = new Product()
            {
                Title = "Tinker Toys",
                Description = "You can build anything you want",
                Price = 32.49,
                Quantity = 25
            };

            Customer marcus = new Customer()
            {
                FirstName = "Marcus",
                LastName = "Fulbright",
                IsLocal = false
            };

            DeliveryService UPS = new DeliveryService()
            {
                Name = "UPS",
                TransitType = "train"
            };

            // Ship the tinker toys to Marcus using UPS
            tinkerToys.Ship(marcus, UPS);
        }
    }
}
```

### Fields

Much like **properties**, **Fields** are use to store values in an object. Unlike properties fields are usually marked as **`private`** meaning they cannot be accessed outside the object. The concept of storing private data that is only accessible inside the object is referred to as **encapsulation**.

```cs
public class Box {
    private string _secret = "Sometimes I sing Aretha Franklin songs in the shower.";

    public string GetSecret(string magicWord) {
        if (magicWord == "please") {
            return _secret;
        } else {
            return "I'm not telling you!";
        }
    }
}
```

```cs
Box box = new Box();
// The following line would cause an error. _secret is not accessible.
// Console.WriteLine(box._secret);

// But public methods and properties can access a private fields.
Console.WriteLine(box.GetSecret("please"));
```

### Constructors

A constructor is special method in a class that is called when a new instance of the class is created. The role of a constructor is to make sure the new object is setup and ready for use immediately after it is created.

```cs
public class Store {
    public Store(string name, List<string> initialInventory) {
        Name = name;
        Inventory = initialInventory;
    }

    public sting Name {get; set;}
    public List<string> Inventory {get; set;}
}
```

We call a constructor when we use the `new` keyword.

```cs
List<string> inventory = new List<string>();
inventory.Add("batteries");
inventory.Add("golf tees");
inventory.Add("zippers");
inventory.Add("cabin accessories"};

// Make a new instance of a Store
Store myStore = new Store("Stuff 'n' Things", inventory);
```

A constructor is not required in a class. If a class does not have a constructor it will be given a hidden, "default" constructor that accepts no parameters and does nothing.

## Practice: Urban Planner

### Setup

```sh
mkdir -p ~/workspace/csharp/exercises/planner && cd $_
dotnet new console -n Planner -o .
touch Building.cs
```

In this exercise, you are going to define your own **`Building`** type and create several instances of it to design your own virtual city. Create a class named **`Building`** in the `Building.cs` file and define the following fields, properties, and methods.

Also make sure that the class is defined in the same namespace as your program.

```cs
namespace Planner
{
    // Define class here
}
```

### Private Fields

- `_designer` of type `string`. It will hold your name.
- `_dateConstructed` of type `DateTime`. This will hold the exact time the building was created.
- `_address` of type string.
- `_owner` of type string. This will store the same of the person who owns the building.

### Public Properties

- `Stories` typed as an integer.
- `Width` typed as a double.
- `Depth` typed as a double.
- `Volume` should be read-only and should return _width * depth * (3 \* # of stories)_. Each story is 3 meters high.

### Constructor

Define a constructor method that accepts a single string argument - `address` - so that you can send as a parameter when you create each instance with `new Building("800 8th Street");`.

- The constructor's logic should set the `_address` field's value to the argument value

### Public Methods

- Define a `Construct()` method. The method's logic should set the `_dateConstructed` field's value to `DateTime.Now`.
- Define a `Purchase()` method. The method should accept a single string argument of the name of the person purchasing a building. The method should take that string and assign it to the private `_owner` field.

Neither of these methods will return a value.

### Build Your City

1. Create several buildings in the `Main()` method of `Program.cs`.
   ```cs
   Building FiveOneTwoEigth = new Building("512 8th Avenue");
   ```
1. Give each building a width, height, and number of stories.
1. Construct each building.
1. Have business people in your city purchase each of your buildings.

After all of the buildings have been purchased, display the following information to the console for each building.

```sh
100 Main Street
---------------
Designed by Steve Brownlee
Constructed on 2/1/18 7:19:08 AM
Owned by Bob Ross
16128 cubic meters of space
```

## Practice: Urban Planner II

Now you need to create a type to represent your city. Here are the requirements for the class. You determine if/when to use fields, properties, a constructor, and methods.

1. Name of the city.
1. The mayor of the city.
1. Year the city was established.
1. A collection of all of the buildings in the city.
1. A method to add a building to the city.

Remember, each class should be in its own file. Create a `City.cs` file and define the **`City`** class in there. Make sure it's in the same namespace as your other classes.

Once the class is defined to your liking, refactor your code in `Main()` to create a new city instance and add your buildings to it. Once all buildings are in the city, refactor your code that outputs the building info to the console to be inside a `foreach` loop that iterate the city's building collection.

##### Example

```cs
City megalopolis = new City();

...

foreach (Building building in megalopolis.Buildings) {
    Console.WriteLine(...);
}
```

## Practice: List employees working at a company

### Setup

```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/csharp/exercises/classes && cd $_
dotnet new console
```

Using C# classes, you need to create custom types to represent an **`Employee`** and a **`Company`**. Then you will create some employees, hire them into the company and then display a simple report showing the employee names and their titles.

![employee list](./assets/AXf6v0ajv6.gif)

### Instructions

1. Create a custom type for `Employee`. An employee has the following properties.
   1. First name (_string_)
   1. Last name (_string_)
   1. Title (_string_)
   1. Start date (_DateTime_)
1. Create a custom type for `Company`. A company has the following properties.
   1. Date founded (_DateTime_)
   1. Company name (_string_)
   1. Employees (_List\<Employee\>_)
1. The `Company` class should also have a `ListEmployees()` method which outputs the name of each employee to the console.
1. In the `Main` method of your console application, create a new instance of Company, and three instances of Employee. Then assign the employees to the company.

---

Copy this `Company` class into your `Program.cs` file to get started. You will define the `Employee` type.

```cs
public class Company
{

    // Some readonly properties (let's talk about gets, baby)
    public string Name { get; }
    public DateTime CreatedOn { get; }

    // Create a public property for holding a list of current employees

    /*
        Create a constructor method that accepts two arguments:
            1. The name of the company
            2. The date it was created

        The constructor will set the value of the public properties
    */
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create an instance of a company. Name it whatever you like.

        // Create three employees

        // Assign the employees to the company

        /*
            Iterate the company's employee list and generate the
            simple report shown above
        */
    }
}
```
