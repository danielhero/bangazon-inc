# The Backend

_You made it_

As you know by now, at NSS we focus on pragmatic, hands-on learning. To that end, we're going to spend most of our time focused on building a powerful, easy-to-use, multi-user blogging platform called _Tabloid<sup>TM</sup>_\*.

> <span>\*</span> _Tabloid_ is a wholly owned subsidiary of _Bangazon Inc._

## Orientation

We'll spend the first few weeks orienting you to .NET Core, C#, SQL, and a new set of tools and techniques for building complex applications.

1. Installation of required tools.
1. Introduction to the C# language.
1. Concepts of sustainable, scalable, object-oriented software development.
1. Overview of server-side development ecosystem
1. How the Internet works
1. Inheritance, composition, and aggregation
1. Entity relationships
1. Structured Query Language (SQL)

At the end of orientation, you will build a command line prototype of the _Tabloid_ application.

## Web Applications using Server-side Rendering

After orientation's focus on the command line development, we'll turn to web applications using Microsoft's powerful, open source [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-3.1) framework.

We'll start with building server-side rendered web apps using [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-3.1). These applications will generate HTML on the server and send it to the browser.

We'll wrap up this phase of the course by building an [MVP](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/) of _Tabloid_.

## Full Stack Web Applications

Finally, we will end the course by learning to build a back-end API using [ASP.NET Core Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/?view=aspnetcore-3.1). This will give us the opportunity to build a dynamic front-end in React.

You will work on three different [Sprints](https://www.scruminc.com/sprint/) while you build the products that Bangazon Corporation needs in order to operate as a modern business. On each of these sprints, you will build features that your product owner has defined in the [Backlog](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/scrum-tools/product-backlog).

We'll end the course wih a two sprint project to build _Tabloid_ as a full stack application.
